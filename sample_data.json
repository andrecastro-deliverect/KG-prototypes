 'text': 'Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the '
         'almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new '
         'blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other '
         'customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm '
         'or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much '
         'more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a '
         'later seating. \n'
         '\n'
         'After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative '
         'over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the '
         'food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and '
         "prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer "
         'half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split '
         'them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled '
         'pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both '
         'were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire '
         'pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic '
         'potato pur√©e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a '
         'romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for '
         'some reason we did not. \n'
         '\n'
         'Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment '
         'above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the '
         'tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it '
         'was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly '
         'like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who '
         'orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. '
         'Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely '
         'the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see '
         "the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to "
         'be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds '
         'on this month of October.',
